- User-Friendly Interface: Clean menu-driven interface
- Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and division by zero
- Continuous Operation: Loop until user chooses to exit
- Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

# Key Programming Concepts Demonstrated
- Functions: Separate functions for each arithmetic operation
- Loops: Main program loop for continuous operation
- Conditionals: Menu selection and input validation
- CLI Interaction: User input/output using input() and print()
- Error Handling: Try-catch blocks for robust input validation

# Usage
- Clone or download the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Run the calculator: python CLI Calculator.py

# How It Works
